1) The value of a will remain 1.


2) An array is an ordered collection of object. A hash is different in that the index or order is arbitrary. 


3) [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq ==> [1,2,3]
   [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq! ==> [1,2,3]
Both have the same output, but the bang (!) actually permnantely changes the array to leave only unique values. Without the bang it is just displaying the unique values in the array.

4) The map function of an array selects parts of an array based on a given logic and puts into a new array. The selection function simply pulls out specific parts of an array. 


5) You would want to place "" marks around the letters to indicate the key in the hast is a string. 


6) No, Way!


7) x = 1
  3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x

answer: X=4

8)
3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x
  
answer: X=3
